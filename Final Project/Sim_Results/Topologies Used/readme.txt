In this folder there are some different topologies used in the simulation

Topology 1: Two nodes communicating 
Topology 2: Three nodes all communicating with each other
Topology 3: Three nodes, but node 1 can't reach node 3, while node 2 can communicate with both of them. (linear topology).
Topology 4: Four motes, each communicating with only the previous and the following (ring topology).
Topology 5: Five motes, star topology (mote 1 in center, and other can communicate only with it)
Topology 6: 6 motes, all comunicating with each other.
